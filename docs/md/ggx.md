# Core Protocol Developer at GGx | Layer 0 protocol

## Overview

GGx is the first programmable Layer 0 with embedded VM and Oracles, accelerating multi-chain DeFi with powerful orchestration capabilities. Utilizing zk-Rollups, Golden Gate enables secure cross-chain communication. As a scalable open relay chain, GGx is critical connecting infrastructure in Web3â€™s internet of blockchains.

At GGx, I hold a key position as a Core Protocol Developer, playing a vital role in advancing the platform's infrastructure. GGx stands at the forefront of the blockchain industry as an Interchain Infrastructure Protocol, integrating cutting-edge technologies such as IBC, Schnorr signatures, ZK Rollups, and Advanced Liquidity Routing to enhance interoperability and scalability.

## Key Contributions

* Substrate-Based Chain Development:
  * Developed blockchain from scratch using Substrate framework
  * Engineered a diverse array of pallets, including a per session reward system for validators and ethereum merkle proof validation, validator whitelist and many others.
* Ethereum Relayer Creation:
  * Designed and implemented an Ethereum relayer, enabling critical interoperability features and facilitating seamless asset transfers between Ethereum and our native chain.
* Iterative Merkle Proof creation and validation implementation
  * Implemented non recursive merkle proof creation and verification that works in non_std environment to prevent possible vector of attack by recursive abuse.
* Aided in the integration of the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol, expanding our chain's capability to connect and transfer information with Cosmos
* Helped with the integration of Multi-Party Computation (MPC), significantly increasing the protocol's privacy-preserving and security capabilities. Unfortunately it was postponed after security issues were identified.
* Conducted thorough reviews of the development of zk-SNARK Groth16 precompile, ensuring the privacy and scalability features met the highest standards.

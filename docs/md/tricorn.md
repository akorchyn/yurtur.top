## Overview

Contributed to a pivotal project focused on establishing a safe and secure cross-chain bridge. This bridge serves as a critical infrastructure piece for interoperability, connecting EVM and non-EVM blockchains such as Ethereum, Casper, and Avalanche, among others.

### Key Contributions

* *Participated in the architectural design* of the bridge, ensuring robust and secure cross-chain transactions that enhance the user experience while maintaining high security standards.
* *Led the development of Rust-based tooling*, streamlining the workflow and improving efficiency in the deployment of the Rust side of the bridge.
* *Crafted and deployed smart contracts on the Casper network*, laying down a reliable foundation for cross-chain interactions.

#### Security Assurance

* The project's *smart contracts and operational integrity were audited by Hallborn*, affirming the high-security standards upheld throughout the development lifecycle.

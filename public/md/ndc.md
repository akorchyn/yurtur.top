# NEAR Digital Collective Ops Team

NEAR Digital Collective is a decentralized governance on the NEAR. (Currently is sunsetting)
As part of the service team, I have developed new private stake-weight voting mechanism

* Collecting and analyzing on-chain data to create a snapshot with stake and activity data for voting.
* Created NEAR and Secret network contracts for encrypted voting
* The relayer is used to hide voting user account.
* The data is stored encrypted and decrypted after voting ends

Also, I have participated in the zk-research for near ecosystem.
During the research I worked with:

* Plonky 2
* Risc0
* Gnark plonky2 verifier by SuccientLabs

# NEAR Digital Collective Ops Team

NEAR Digital Collective is a decentralized governance on the NEAR.
As part of the service team, I have developed a new [private stake-weight voting mechanism](https://github.com/near-ndc/voting-v2).
NDC was sunsetted in June 2024.

* *Collecting and analyzing on-chain data* to create a snapshot with stake and activity data for voting.
* *Created NEAR and Secret network contracts* for encrypted voting.
* *The relayer* is used to hide voting user account.
* *The data is stored encrypted* and decrypted after voting ends.

Also, I have participated in the zk-research for the NEAR ecosystem.
During the research I worked with:

* *Plonky 2*
* *Risc0*
* *Gnark plonky2 verifier by SuccinctLabs*

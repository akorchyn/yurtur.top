### Overview

As a Junior C++ Engineer, I was tasked with maintaining and updating the SDK for the legacy mobile SDK for 'Here WeGo' while a new SDK was in development. My role involved ensuring the application's performance and functionality kept pace with modern standards and user expectations.

### Key Contributions

* *SDK Maintenance*:
  * Diligently updated and maintained the SDK, guaranteeing compatibility with the latest mobile operating systems and hardware.
* *Bug Resolution*:
  * Investigated and resolved issues reported by clients, enhancing application stability and user satisfaction. Improved routing algorithms by adjusting heuristics.
* *Continuous Improvement*:
  * Collaborated with the development team to refine the application's features and performance through iterative updates.

## Project 2: Map Routing & Data Format Optimization

### Overview

Transitioning to a Middle C++ Engineer role, I contributed to the development of a new map format designed to optimize routing speed. This initiative involved building various components from scratch and refining routing algorithms to leverage the new data format.

### Key Contributions

* *Map Format Development*:
  * Participated in designing and implementing a new data format as part of the routing team.
* *Performance Profiling*:
  * Conducted thorough profiling of the new system to identify and resolve performance bottlenecks.
* *Test Coverage*:
  * Ensured reliability and stability by implementing comprehensive test suites for new components.
